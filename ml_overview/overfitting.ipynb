    "# Overfitting and Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics and machine learning, overfitting occurs when a statistical model describes random errors or noise instead of the underlying relationships. Overfitting generally occurs when a model is **excessively complex**, such as having **too many parameters relative to the number of observations**. A model that has been overfit will generally have poor predictive performance, as it can exaggerate minor fluctuations in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A learning algorithm is trained using some set of training samples. If the learning algorithm has the capacity to overfit the training samples the performance on the **training sample set** will improve while the performance on unseen **test sample set** will decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overfitting phenomenon has three main explanations:\n",
    " - excessively complex models,\n",
    " - multicollinearity, and\n",
    " - high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Causes of Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictors are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least not within the sample data set; it only affects computations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. In case of perfect multicollinearity the predictor matrix is singular and therefore cannot be inverted. Under these circumstances, for a general linear model $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, the ordinary least-squares estimator, $\\mathbf{w}_{OLS} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$, does not exist.\n",

    "### The Challenges of High Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "High-dimensional data refers to datasets with a large number of input features ($P$). In linear models, each feature corresponds to a parameter, so when the number of features $P$ is large compared to the number of training samples $N$ (the \"**large P, small N**\" problem), the model tends to overfit the training data. This phenomenon is part of the **curse of dimensionality**, which describes the difficulties that arise when working in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most critical factors in selecting a machine learning algorithm is the relationship between $P$ and $N$, as it significantly impacts model performance. Below are three key problems associated with high-dimensionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Infinite Solutions and Ill-Conditioned Matrices**\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear models, the covariance matrix $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ is of size $P \\times P$ and has rank $\\min(N, P)$. When $P > N$, the system of equations becomes **overparameterized**, meaning there are infinitely many possible solutions that fit the training data. This leads to poor generalization, as the learned solutions may be highly specific to the dataset. In such cases, the covariance matrix is singular or ill-conditioned, making it unstable for inversion in methods like ordinary least squares regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exponential Growth of Sample Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "The density of data points in a high-dimensional space decreases exponentially with increasing $P$. Specifically, the effective sampling density of $N$ points in a $P$-dimensional space is proportional to $N^{1/P}$. As a result, the data becomes increasingly sparse as $P$ grows, making it difficult to estimate distributions or learn meaningful patterns. To maintain a constant density, the number of required samples grows exponentially. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **1D**, 50 samples provide reasonable coverage.\n",
    "- In **2D**, approximately **2,500** samples are needed for equivalent density.\n",
    "- In **3D**, around **125,000** samples are required.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This illustrates why high-dimensional problems often suffer from a lack of sufficient training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Data Points Lie on the Edge of the Space**\n",
    "\n",
    "In high-dimensional spaces, most data points are **closer to the boundary of the sample space** than to any other data point. Consider $N$ points uniformly distributed in a $P$-dimensional unit ball. The median distance from the origin to the nearest neighbor is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d(P, N) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}^{1/N}\\right)^{1/P}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with $N = 500$ and $P = 10$, this distance is approximately **0.52**, meaning that most data points are more than halfway to the boundary. This has severe consequences for prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In lower dimensions, models **interpolate** between data points.  \n",
    "- In high dimensions, models must **extrapolate**, which is significantly harder and less reliable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This explains why many machine learning algorithms perform poorly in high-dimensional settings and why dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, feature selection) are essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The curse of dimensionality creates fundamental challenges for machine learning, including overparameterization, data sparsity, and unreliable predictions. Addressing these issues requires strategies such as **dimensionality reduction**, **regularization**, and **feature selection** to ensure that models generalize well and remain computationally efficient.\n",
