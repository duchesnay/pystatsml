    "[Gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) is an optimization algorithm to minimize a **cost or loss function** $f$ given its parameter $w$. The algorithm **iteratively moves in the direction of steepest descent** as defined by the **opposite direction the gradient**. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of our model. **Parameters** refer to **coefficients** in **Linear Regression** and **weights** in **neural networks**.\n",

    "### Choosing the Step Size\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With large learning rate $\\gamma$ we can cover more ground each step, but we **risk overshooting the lowest point** since the slope of the hill is constantly changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a very small learning rate**, we can confidently move in the direction of the negative gradient since we are recalculating it so frequently. A small learning rate is more precise, but calculating the gradient is time-consuming, leading too slow convergence\n",

    "**Line search** can be used (or more sophisticated [Backtracking line search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking_line_search)) to find value of $\\gamma$ such that $f(\\textbf{w}_{k} - \\gamma \\nabla f(\\textbf{w}_{k}))$ is minimum. However such simple method ignore possible change of the curvature.\n",

    "- Benefit of gradient decent: simplicity and versatility, almost any function with a gradient can be minimized.\n",
    "- Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Local minima (local optimization) for non-convex problem.\n",
    "    * Convergence speed: With fast changing curvature (gradient direction) the estimation of gradient will rapidly become wrong moving away from $x_k$ suggesting small step-size. This also suggest the integration of change of the gradient direction in the calculus of the step size. "

    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing a proper learning rate can be difficult. A learning rate that is too small leads to painfully slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large can hinder convergence and cause the loss function to fluctuate around the minimum or even to diverge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning rate schedules try to adjust the learning rate during training by e.g. annealing, i.e. reducing the learning rate according to a pre-defined schedule or when the change in objective between epochs falls below a threshold. These schedules and thresholds, however, have to be defined in advance and are thus unable to adapt to a dataset's characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, the same learning rate applies to all parameter updates. If our data is sparse and our features have very different frequencies, we might not want to update all of them to the same extent, but perform a larger update for rarely occurring features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another key challenge of minimizing highly non-convex error functions common for neural networks is avoiding getting trapped in their numerous suboptimal local minima. These [saddle points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point) are usually surrounded by a plateau of the same error, which makes it notoriously hard for SGD to escape, as the gradient is close to zero in all dimensions.\n",
